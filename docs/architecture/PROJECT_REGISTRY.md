## Summary

- Owner: fawxzzy
- Projects: 8
- Active projects: 7
- Deployment-mapped projects: 5

## State Model

- Rule: Desired state, observed state, and health judgment must remain separate machine fields.
- Pattern: `desiredState -> observedState -> healthState -> derived prose`.
- Failure mode: Scorecards built on blended status fields create false precision and rewrite pressure.
- Legacy compatibility: `status` remains present for existing consumers, but migrated projects derive it from the split model.
- Rule: Scorecards consume split-state truth; they do not replace registry evidence.
- Pattern: `desiredState -> observedState -> healthState -> scorecard -> recommended next action`.
- Failure mode: Numeric scores without evidence explanations create false confidence.

- Observed: repo `verified`, deployment `ready`, database `observed`, proof `current`
- Observed summary: Foundation observes a verified public repo, READY production deployment, current deployment proof, and an active Supabase project with advisor evidence.
- Health judgment: overall `warning`, quality `advisory`
- Health summary: Deployment proof is clean and the completed SQL remediation waves are proved, but the leaked-password control is currently plan-blocked and unused-index review remains observation-only, so Fitness privacy and database posture stay below healthy.
- Health warning: Wave 1A search_path hardening, Wave 1C SECURITY DEFINER execute-permission remediation, Wave 1B FK covering indexes, Wave 2A-1 session-core RLS initplan rewrites, Wave 2A-2 routine-core RLS initplan rewrites, Wave 2A-3 profile/catalog RLS initplan rewrites, and Wave 2A-4 session-follow-up-job RLS initplan rewrites are now proved in Supabase advisor evidence, but leaked password protection remains disabled and Supabase rejected the operator enablement attempt because the Fitness org is on the free plan.
- Health warning: auth_rls_initplan findings are now cleared for Fitness; unused index observations remain review-only and do not change posture.
- Health warning: Historical prod-deploy mapping remains documented until active inventory or remediation changes.
- Legacy compatibility status: `active`
- Scorecard: `warning` 85/100
- Score Evidence completeness: `pass` 25/25 - Split-state truth, production deployment evidence, and Supabase observation data are all present.

- Score warning: Wave 1A search_path hardening, Wave 1C SECURITY DEFINER execute-permission remediation, Wave 1B FK covering indexes, Wave 2A-1 session-core RLS initplan rewrites, Wave 2A-2 routine-core RLS initplan rewrites, Wave 2A-3 profile/catalog RLS initplan rewrites, and Wave 2A-4 session-follow-up-job RLS initplan rewrites are now proved in Supabase advisor evidence, but leaked password protection remains disabled and Supabase rejected the operator enablement attempt because the Fitness org is on the free plan.
- Score warning: auth_rls_initplan findings are now cleared for Fitness; unused index observations remain review-only and do not change posture.
- Score warning: Historical prod-deploy mapping remains documented until active inventory or remediation changes.
- Score next action: Keep the leaked-password control recorded as a reviewed free-plan blocker unless Fitness crosses a launch/readiness gate, keep unused-index review observation-only, and require reviewed advisor proof before changing posture.

- GitHub Actions Foundation CI push run 25131302841 completed successfully for commit abda5a586716d356f7c2bb1e670f5783f80b0fed at 2026-04-29T20:10:19Z.
- Latest Vercel production deployment dpl_8CbDvRtaeq7gxSbCAg94r7vWR8A2 reached READY at 2026-04-30T00:51:18Z and serves https://fawxzzy-foundation.vercel.app.
- Clean deployment provenance is pinned to commit abda5a586716d356f7c2bb1e670f5783f80b0fed with source cli, actor codex, and no gitDirty flag.
- Promotion proof is pinned to commit abda5a586716d356f7c2bb1e670f5783f80b0fed and deployment dpl_8CbDvRtaeq7gxSbCAg94r7vWR8A2. Later production deployments may refresh the live console display from newer source commits, including 36ac2970c77160c4e7efdcc881eb3b53f3b3182f, without changing that original promotion proof.
- GitHub's legacy combined-status endpoint still reports pending with zero status contexts for this commit, but the public check-runs and workflow-run APIs show a completed successful Foundation CI push run. Those check surfaces are the authoritative proof here.
- Promotion proof commit: `abda5a586716d356f7c2bb1e670f5783f80b0fed` (Record Foundation Vercel deployment proof)
- Vercel project `fawxzzy-foundation`: latest production deployment dpl_5c92EdvaBSLNdJ6dGH8zxTkiYAbU is READY for 36ac2970c77160c4e7efdcc881eb3b53f3b3182f on alias fawxzzy-foundation.vercel.app

| Gate | State |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub repo exists | [x] |
| main pushed and tracking origin/main | [x] |
| Foundation self-registry fixed | [x] |
| Generated registry surfaces aligned | [x] |
| Local pnpm build passed | [x] |

| Vercel deployment exists | [x] |
| Vercel deployment verified | [x] |
| Registry records Vercel deployment proof | [x] |
| Foundation promoted to active control-plane | [x] |

Next valid move:
1. Maintain green GitHub Actions and clean Vercel provenance on future control-plane commits
2. Keep generated registry surfaces aligned with data/projects.json
3. Expand deployment health coverage for downstream project surfaces


## Principles

- private-first runtime artifacts
- deterministic project registry
- brief-thin human surfaces with machine-readable JSON truth
- modular repos under a shared governance layer
